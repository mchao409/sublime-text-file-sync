This is a plugin for Sublime Text that allows you to to synchronize your files using hosting services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, allowing you to access the same file on different machines. (Currently in progress)

Can only use default modules included in Python 3 or include [dependency]("https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/blob/master/repository/dependencies.json") in the plugin code.
