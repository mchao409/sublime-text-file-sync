# Sublime Text File Sync
##### Created for CSC-630: The Open Source Movement at Phillips Academy


This is a plugin for Sublime Text that allows you to to synchronize your files using hosting services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive, allowing you to access the same file on different machines. (Currently in progress)


##### Functions: 
* Upload files to and grab files from hosting services.
* Share files with other people

##### Progress:
Can only use default modules included in Python 3 -- there are dependencies available for external libraries, but many do not seem to work, so sticking with default installed libraries is the safest bet.
