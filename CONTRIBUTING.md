#### Installing the repository
1. Make sure you have Sublime Text 3 installed. You can get it [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).
2. Open your command line and type in `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/`. This is where Sublime Text finds all of its plugins.
3. Clone the repository in this folder using `git clone`. 

#### Running plugins

You can read up the documentation on Sublime Text 3 plugins [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html).

##### External Libraries
This repository only use default modules included in Python 3, unless the source code is added in the `lib` folder, due to Sublime's Plugin API restrictions. Currently, only the `requests` module is there.
